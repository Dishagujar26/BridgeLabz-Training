# BridgeLabz-Training

### 📅 Day 1 – OOPs, POPs, Classes & Objects
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Learned OOPs and POPs concepts and understood why Object-Oriented Programming is preferred over Procedural Programming
- Studied classes and objects using a real-world Food Delivery App example to model data and behaviour
- Followed best programming practices such as encapsulation, meaningful naming conventions, constructors, and use of comments
- Implemented an OOP-based program demonstrating object creation, method usage, and memory allocation

### 📅 Day 2 – Constructors, Instance Variables, Methods & Access Modifiers
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the concept of constructors and their types: `default`, `parameterised` and `copy` constructors
- Learned about class instance variables and instance methods
- Explored access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default` to control data visibility
- Implemented Java programs demonstrating constructor usage, instance variables, methods, and access control

### 📅 Day 3 – Static, this, final & instanceof
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Learned how to use `static` for shared values and utility methods to reduce memory usage and avoid redundancy
- Leveraged `this` keyword to avoid ambiguity while initialising `instance variables`
- Understood the use of `final variables` for constants and identifiers that should not change
- Used `instanceof` for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during type casting

### 📅 Day 4 – Object-Oriented Design Principles
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

- Explored core OOP design principles with a focus on `object modelling` concepts
- Studied Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams in detail
- Understood and compared relationships: `Association`, `Aggregation`, `Composition`, and `Communication`

### 📅 Day 5 – Inheritance in Java
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

- Learned `Single`, `Multilevel`, and `Hierarchical` inheritance using classes to reuse and extend common behaviour
- Understood that `Multiple inheritance` is not supported with classes in Java due to `ambiguity` (diamond problem)
- Implemented `Hybrid` inheritance using `interfaces`, combining extends and implements for multiple behaviours
