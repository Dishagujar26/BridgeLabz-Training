# BridgeLabz-Training

### 📅 Day 1 – Explored DSA and Practised LinkedList Problems
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Studied Data Structures and Algorithms to organise data efficiently; covered `linear` (array, linked list, stack, queue) and `non-linear` (tree, graph) structures.
- Importance: Improves problem-solving, optimises `time/space complexity`, and builds strong coding and interview foundations.
- Implemented and practised Linked Lists, `singly`, `doubly`, and `circular Linked List` with core operations.
