### 📅 Day 1 – Generics in Java 
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

-  Studied `Java Generics` to ensure strong compile-time type safety and eliminate explicit type casting.
-  Designed `generic classes and methods` using type parameters to improve code reusability and maintainability.
-  Applied `bounded type parameters` to logically restrict types and enforce domain-specific constraints.
-  Used `wildcards (? extends, ? super)` to build flexible, readable, and robust APIs for real-world scenarios.
