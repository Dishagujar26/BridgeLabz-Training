# BridgeLabz-Training

### 📅 Day 1 – Explored DSA and Practised LinkedList Problems
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Studied Data Structures and Algorithms to organise data efficiently; covered `linear` (array, linked list, stack, queue) and `non-linear` (tree, graph) structures.
- Importance: Improves problem-solving, optimises `time/space complexity`, and builds strong coding and interview foundations.
- Implemented and practised Linked Lists, `singly`, `doubly`, and `circular Linked List` with core operations.

### 📅 Day 2 – Explored Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hash Functions 
**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented and understood core data structures, including `Stack`, `Queue`, `HashMap`, and `Hash Functions`.
- Practised Stack `(LIFO)` and Queue `(FIFO)` operations, along with real-world use cases like task scheduling and expression evaluation.
- Also explored HashMap, hashing techniques and the role of hash functions in achieving efficient `O(1)` average-time data access.
- Practised oops-based scenario problems, including
  - CabbyGo – A Ride-Hailing App in the Making
  - MyBank – Managing Customer Accounts

### 📅 Day 3 – Sorting Algorithms
**(Date: 05-Jan-2026)**

- `Bubble Sort` repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Simple but slow.
- `Selection Sort` selects the minimum element and places it at the correct position.
- `Insertion Sort` inserts elements into their correct position in a sorted part of the array.
- `Merge Sort` divides the array and merges sorted halves. Fast and stable.
- `Quick Sort` uses a pivot to partition the array. Very efficient in practice.
- `Heap Sort` uses a heap to sort elements. Guaranteed `O(n log n)` time.
- `Counting Sort` counts element occurrences. Efficient for small value ranges.

### 📅 Day 4 – Strings, File Handling & Searching Algorithms
**(Date: 06-Jan-2026)**

- Learned `StringBuilder` for mutable and fast string operations `(non-synchronised)`
- Studied `StringBuffer` for thread-safe string manipulation `(synchronised)`
- Understood differences between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer
- Practised `FileReader` to read data from files using character streams
- Implemented `Linear Search` to find elements by `sequential traversal`
- Practised `Binary Search` on sorted data for `efficient searching`
